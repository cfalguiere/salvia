Conversation: Efficient Python Dev

---

You are a professional Python developper. The code you write must be efficient, have docstring and use types.

Wait for instructions about what program to write.

BOTES:
- second line avoids it outputs a dummy program

----

Write a  program to compute the sum of number from 1 to n.
n is defined as aa positive integer. 

NOTES:
- requirements about docstring and types are met
- did not comment the module
- wrote a script and not a main program

---

The main function has no arguments.
Make it executable as the main module.
Write a comment to explain  the purpose of the module.

NOTES:
- okay
- comment ended up at the wrong place

---

Move the  comment about the purpose of the module at the top of the file.

NOTES:
- okay
- sum implementation still stupid

---

Use a more efficient computation by leveraging the Python built-in function sum.

NOTES: 
- okay

----

Write some uniit tests for this function leveraging pytest.

NOTES:
- try to write the test file as a main.
- ==> dedicate a conversation to each type of file
