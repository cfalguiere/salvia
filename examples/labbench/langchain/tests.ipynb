      " Alice falls into a deep pit of sticks and dry leaves, talking to herself on the way down. While falling, she inadvertently puts an empty jar of Orange Marmalade in the cupboard. She hopes her pet cat, Dinah, will not miss her as she falls, and is relieved when the fall comes to an end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice jumped up and followed the White Rabbit down a passage, hearing it exclaim how late it was getting. When she turned the corner the Rabbit was gone and she found herself in a long low hall illuminated by lamps. There were many doors in the hall, with no sign of the Rabbit in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice came upon a mysterious little table in the hall she was exploring. The only object on the table was a small golden key, but it ended up being too small to open any of the doors.

Unfortunately, she finds she has forgotten her key to the garden, and cannot reach it from where she is. She attempts to climb the table but her size prevents her from succeeding.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice attempts various ways to reach a key and tires herself out trying. She then talks to herself and scolds herself harshly. She then finds a small box which contains a cake with the words \"Eat Me\" written on it. She decides to eat the cake, hoping it will make her large enough to reach the key.\n",
      "\n",

      "A young girl eats a small bit of cake and finds that, contrary to her expectations, she does not physically grow bigger or smaller and decides she can get into the garden either way. She then finishes off the cake.\n",

      "Alice is unable to get through into the garden and, overwhelmed with tears, she sits down and cries. Eventually, she hears pattering in the distance and looks up to see the White Rabbit rushing towards her, dressed splendidly and holding a pair of white gloves and a fan. He is worried he has kept the Duchess waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice is startled when the Rabbit starts violently and runs away, and then she finds herself with two objects - a fan and a pair of white gloves - that don't belong to her. She is perplexed at how her day has suddenly changed from ordinary to bizarre, and begins to question her identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice notices that she has put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while talking and fears she is shrinking. She measures herself and discovers she is two feet tall and shrinking rapidly. She realizes the fan she was holding was causing her to shrink and quickly drops it, \"just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.\" Though frightened by the sudden change, Alice is relieved to still exist and excitedly heads for the garden.\n",

      "\n",
      "A child had a dream where she became small and was unable to open a small golden door. Just then, she slips and finds herself up to her chin in a pool of tears that she had wept when she was nine feet tall. She then hears something else splashing around and finds it to be a mouse who had also slipped in.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice, feeling out-of-place, wonders if the mouse can talk and decides to try talking to it. When it does not answer, she assumes it may be a French mouse and attempts to communicate in French. However, it still does not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice accidentally scares a mouse and quickly apologizes, then offers to show the mouse her pet cat Dinah to try and prove the mouse would like cats. However, the mouse is offended and Alice quickly drops the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Alice attempts to change the subject of conversation after a mouse becomes appalled at the mention of cats. She runs the risk of offending the mouse again when she brings up dogs, but it swims away in fear.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice encourages a mouse to come back and tells the mouse she won't talk about cats or dogs if it doesn't like them. The mouse agrees, and Alice leads a large group of animals and birds that have fallen into a pool to the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the bank, a strange looking group of animals and birds, all wet and bedraggled, have gathered.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice finds herself speaking with a group of animals who were trying to figure out how to get dry. The Mouse, with authority, calls for all of them to sit down and listen to a plan which turns out to be a story about the life of William the Conqueror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaders of England, namely Edwin and Morcar, earls of Mercia and Northumbria, and Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William to offer him the throne. The Duck questions what exactly the archbishop found, but the Mouse does not address the query.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice is very wet and the Dodo suggests a Caucus-race to get them dry. The Eaglet does not understand the Dodo's long words and questions its meaning. The Dodo then explains that a Caucus-race is the best way to get them dry.\n",
      "\n",
      " In an unusual race, the Dodo marked out a circle-shaped race course and all the participants began running without a starting signal, and when they had been running for thirty minutes they finished and asked who had won. The Dodo had no answer for this question and needed to think it over.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Alice is handed the responsibility of handing out prizes to everyone with no idea what to do. She solves the problem by handing out comfits from her pocket, one to each person. There is then a commotion as the birds complain that they cannot taste them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice and the Mouse have just finished a song, and Alice is asking the Mouse to tell her its history. The Mouse explains that it is a long and sad tale, and Alice is puzzled by this remark as she looks down at the Mouse's tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fury and a mouse have a heated conversation about going to court, and Fury ultimately declares himself the judge and jury of their conflict, sentencing the mouse to death.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice is scolded by the Mouse for not paying attention to its story and not understanding what it is saying. The Mouse leaves in a huff, but the other animals urge Alice to bring it back. Alice wishes she had her pet cat Dinah with her, eliciting a scared reaction from the birds.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice is left alone after her friends leave and wishes she hadn't mentioned Dinah, who no-one seemed to like. She feels lonely and starts to cry, but soon hears the pattering of footsteps in the distance and looks up eagerly.\n",

      "Alice hears the White Rabbit muttering to itself, concerned that the Duchess will execute it for losing the fan and pair of white kid-gloves. Alice offers to help the Rabbit search for them, but they are nowhere to be found because everything has changed since Alice's dip in the pool.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice meets a Rabbit who accuses her of being his housemaid Mary Ann and orders her to fetch his gloves and fan. She finds a neat little house with the Rabbit's name on a brass plate and goes in without knocking. She is afraid of meeting the real Mary Ann before she can find the fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice finds her way into a room with a table in the window, containing a fan and some gloves. She notices a bottle and drinks from it, hoping it will make her grow large again. When she drinks half of the bottle she finds her head pressing against the ceiling, so she hastily puts it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A character wishes she wouldn't grow anymore, but sadly she continues to grow rapidly. As a result, she kneels on the floor, puts her arm out the window and her foot up the chimney, and is uncertain of her fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice has been saved from growing larger thanks to the little magic bottle. She hears a voice calling out for Mary Ann and knows it is the Rabbit coming for her. She is so frightened she shakes the house, forgetting that she is now much larger than the Rabbit and has no reason to be afraid. The Rabbit tries to open the door but Alice's elbow is in the way preventing it from opening.\n",
      "\n",
      " After a failed attempt, Alice heard a voice saying it was going to try the window. She then made a grab in the air and heard a crash of broken glass. An angry voice, the Rabbit's, then appeared demanding \"Pat! Pat!\" in which a voice Alice had never heard before replied \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\"\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice overhears whispers and then sees an arm in the window. The person is ordered to take the arm away, followed by two little shrieks and more broken glass. Alice wonders what will happen next and wishes they could pull her out of the window. After waiting some time, she hears a rumbling of cart-wheels and the sound of many people.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice hears people talking about the need to get a ladder and to have someone go down the chimney. After she puts her foot down the chimney, she hears a little animal scratching and then a general chorus of voices yelling \"there goes Bill!\" Then the Rabbit's voice yells to catch him, and then a confusion of voices follows. Finally, Alice hears someone say \"hold up his head--Brandy!\".\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice hears a small squeaky voice exclaim, \"something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" Then she hears the Rabbit say \"A barrowful will do, to begin with\", before a shower of pebbles hits her in the face which surprisingly turn into little cakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice finds herself in a room with cakes and decides to eat one, shrinking in size and running out into a wood where she meets the Duchess and other animals. Alice makes a decision to begin her journey, tucking her arm in with the Duchess.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice, shrunken in size, ventures into a wood and wonders what she should eat or drink to grow to her original size. She looks around but is unable to find anything to suit her needs until she finds a mushroom of similar height as herself. On the mushroom, she spots a blue caterpillar and meets its eyes.\n",

      "\n",
      " Alice, feeling confused and shy, tells the Caterpillar that she is in a state of confusion due to the fact that she changes sizes multiple times a day. The Caterpillar demands she explain herself and Alice replies that she is unable to, prompting the Caterpillar to ask why she should explain herself first. Alice, unable to think of a good reason, turns away from the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice returns to the Caterpillar for advice after realizing she has changed significantly in size. The Caterpillar then asks her what size she wants to be and Alice says she doesn't mind, she just doesn't like changing often.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice expresses her dissatisfaction with her three inch height and is met with the Caterpillar's irritation. The Caterpillar then proceeds to tell her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her shrink, before disappearing.\n",
      "\n",
      " Alice attempted to determine the two sides of a mushroom, breaking off pieces with each hand. She nibbled the right-hand bit to try the effect, only to be struck underneath her chin by her own foot as she suddenly shrunk. In an attempt to regain control, Alice began to quickly eat the other bit, her chin pressed against her foot.\n",
