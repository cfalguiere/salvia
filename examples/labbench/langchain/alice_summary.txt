Alice visits the Queen's Croquet Ground and is asked to play a game of croquet with the Queen. Alice is surprised to find that the balls are live hedgehogs and the mallets are flamingos. After winning the game, Alice is invited to join the Queen's procession and finds herself in a court of justice, where she is put on trial for stealing the Queen's tarts. Alice is defended by the White Rabbit and the jury is made up of animals and birds. Alice is found not guilty, but the Queen is furious and orders Alice to leave. Alice is saved by the Cheshire Cat who appears and tells the Queen that she can't do anything to Alice. Alice then meets the Duchess who is out of prison and they walk off together, but the Queen appears and gives Alice a warning. Alice then has a dream in which she encounters a pack of cards that come to life and try to attack her. She wakes up to find her sister and they go home.
